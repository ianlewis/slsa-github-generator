# Generation of SLSA3+ provenance for Docker images projects

This document explains how to use the builder for Docker images. A builder and
set of workflows is provided that allows developers to build Docker images from
a Dockerfile, generate provenance for the image, and upload the image and
provenance to image repositories.

## Development status

This builder is currently under active development. It is not recommended to use
at this time.
